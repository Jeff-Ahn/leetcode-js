// 1143. Longest Common Subsequence
// Difficulty: Medium

/* Description */
// Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

// A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

// For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
// A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

/* Constraints */
// 1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000
// text1 and text2 consist of only lowercase English characters.

/**
 * @param {string} text1
 * @param {string} text2
